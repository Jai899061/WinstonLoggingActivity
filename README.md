Winston is the most popular logging library for Node.js. It aims to make logging more flexible and extensible by decoupling different aspects such as log levels, formatting, and storage so that each API is independent and many combinations are supported. It also uses Node.js streams to minimize the performance impact of implementing logging in your application.

In this tutorial, we will explain how to install, set up, and use the Winston logger in a Node.js application. We'll go through all the options it provides and show how to customize them in various ways. Finally, we'll describe how to use it in conjunction with Morgan middleware for logging incoming requests in Express server.
